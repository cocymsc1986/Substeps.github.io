This readme covers the maintenance and development of these docs

Content is maintained on the orphan content branch and built there into the _site folder using jekyll.

generated artifacts are then copied and committed to the master branch from _site

Travis takes care of all that though!

To run locally: 

```bundle exec jekyll serve```
